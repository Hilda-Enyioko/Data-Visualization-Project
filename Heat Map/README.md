# Visualize Data with a Heat Map

## Overview
This project is a data visualization heat map built using D3.js. The heat map represents global temperature variations over time, displaying data points in a color-coded grid. 

## Objective
The heat map is designed to be functionally similar to the reference project provided by freeCodeCamp: [Heat Map Example](https://heat-map.freecodecamp.rocks). The goal is to pass all user stories specified in the freeCodeCamp challenge.

## Features
- Displays a title (`#title`) and a description (`#description`).
- Contains an x-axis (`#x-axis`) representing years.
- Contains a y-axis (`#y-axis`) representing months.
- Uses `rect` elements (`.cell`) to represent temperature data.
- Implements a color scale with at least 4 different fill colors.
- Displays a legend (`#legend`) with color-coded reference values.
- Provides an interactive tooltip (`#tooltip`) that displays detailed information on hover.
- Aligns all cells with their respective month and year labels.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the page
- **CSS** for styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactivity
- **D3.js** for data visualization

## Dataset
The project uses the global temperature dataset from freeCodeCamp:  
[Global Temperature Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json)
