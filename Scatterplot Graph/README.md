# Scatterplot Graph

## Overview
This project is a data visualization app that displays a scatterplot graph using D3.js. It is built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization Certification and meets all the required user stories.

## Features
- Displays a scatterplot graph with x-axis and y-axis.
- Plots data points representing cyclist performance times.
- Includes axis labels and ticks for clear data representation.
- Tooltip appears when hovering over data points, displaying additional information.
- Legend included for better data interpretation.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- D3.js (Data-Driven Documents)

## User Stories
1. A title element with `id="title"` is displayed.
2. An x-axis with `id="x-axis"` is present.
3. A y-axis with `id="y-axis"` is present.
4. Data points (dots) have a class of `dot`.
5. Each dot has `data-xvalue` and `data-yvalue` attributes.
6. Data values are within the correct range and format.
7. Data points align correctly with the x-axis.
8. Data points align correctly with the y-axis.
9. Y-axis tick labels use `%M:%S` time format.
10. X-axis tick labels display the year.
11. X-axis labels are within the data range.
12. Y-axis labels are within the data range.
13. A legend with `id="legend"` is included.
14. A tooltip with `id="tooltip"` appears on hover.
15. Tooltip contains a `data-year` property corresponding to `data-xvalue`.
